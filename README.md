# d3-in-motion
Code examples and references for the course "D3.js in Motion". (WORK IN PROGRESS)

Uses the [example-viewer](https://github.com/curran/example-viewer) package.

To use the example viewer, go to https://curran.github.io/d3-in-motion/#1/2/1 . Navigation can be done with CTRL+Right/Left Arrow, or CTRL+SHIFT+Right/Left Arrow. The editor is live, so students can play with the examples easily in the viewer itself. The URL convention mirrors the hierarchical structure `#/unit/module/example`, so to move between modules, students can change the number in the URL (hoping to make navigation more user-friendly soon!).
